# The Canyon Module System

*Not an interface for training neural networks. See the Canyon repository. 

The Canyon Module System is a collection of Modules, or Layers, which perform Neural Network operations. We have support for DNN, CNN, and RNN Layers which can be used to create a high-level interface.
Canyon-core is designed to be easy to understand and use.
