# The Soul Module System

*Not an interface for training neural networks. See the Soul repository. 

The Soul Module System is a collection of Modules, or Layers, which perform Neural Network operations. We have support for DNN, CNN, and RNN Layers which can be used to create a high-level interface.
Soul-core is designed to be easy to understand and use.
